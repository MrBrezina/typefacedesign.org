Preview:
- try to keep the appearing size close to the attached example or the 2008 previews at the website. Use your Latins, non-Latins, Regular, Italic, whatever you want.

Modify the attached preview template (with guidelines in Illustrator), few notes:
- outline the text
- use pure black (RGB: 0,0,0), check it in the colour dialog
- keep the background transparent
- use the left (28px) and right (-28px) borders as optical margins
- follow the baseline (19px from the bottom) as much as you can
- keep the visual height the same as Ronnia or smaller
- save as a  PDF
- name it NameSurname_Typefacename.pdf (e.g. GerbenDollen_Actium.pdf)
